# probabilistic-programming
Notebooks for probabilistic programming. Notebook 01_CloudBlog.ipynb shows the notebook for the problem walked through in the blog post here https://medium.com/informatics-lab/probabilistic-programming-1535d7882dbe.

These notebooks require Pyro which can be installed from here https://pyro.ai and PyTorch https://pytorch.org 

For example:

    pip install pyro-ppl 
  
    conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
